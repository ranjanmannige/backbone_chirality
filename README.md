# backbone_chirality

To setup: <br>
<b>1)</b> Uncompress 'local_imports.tar.gz' and 'raw_data.tgz' by right-clicking on the file and choosing on the rigt options or ">tar xvzf something.tar.gz'<br>
<b>2)</b> make sure that you have access to Python <v3.0 (try '>which python'; '>' indicates the command line prompt), and, the following python modules: Numpy, Biopython, Matplotlib.
<b>3)</b> In case you want to re-compile the Latex file (within manuscript/), run '>python compileme.py'. For it to work out-of-the-box, you will need pdflatex (try '>pdflatex') and bibtex (try '>bibtex'). To use another latex executable, modify 'manuscript/compileme.py'.<br>
<b>4)</b> To re-render peptide configurations, you will need VMD (try '>vmd'; it is available here: <a href='http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/'>www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/</a>).<br>
